Pytorch Learning Notes
===
variables.py -- What is PyTorch? from Pytorch official tutorials Deeplearning with PyTorch:A 60 Minute Blitz

autograd.py Tries based on on th auto grad part, there are some questions about y.backward()

network.py Learn to construct networks, only finish the network initialization, forward and backward. Still have some questions.

All codes are from

To do list:
+ Weight Initialization
+ Fine-tune Optimizer
+ Torch Fundamental Loss
+ Self-defined Loss
+ Spatial Transformation Network
+ Some useful functions
    + save checkpoint
    + load checkpoint
    + update model weight partialy
+ Sequential
+ Dataset and Dataloader
+ GPU and Multi-gpu trianing
    + torch.cuda related
+ Pytorch and visdom
+ LSTM and RNN
+ Optimizing training...

Welcome to share any other pytorch tricks to improve coding skills together.

If there is any fault please point it through Issue and I will update codes ASAP.

Hope this repo can help you.
